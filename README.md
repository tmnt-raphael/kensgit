## Introduction

This project contains my Vim configurations. It also has the color scheme that I use.

## Instructions (only works on Mac)

To have the same Vim color scheme that I use, save the [.vimrc](https://github.com/tmnt-raphael/kensvim/blob/master/.vimrc) file and [.vim](https://github.com/tmnt-raphael/kensvim/tree/master/.vim) folder to your home directory.

## Sample

Here is a sample of how the color scheme looks like when doing React programming:
